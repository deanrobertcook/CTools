# CTools
A repository for leaning Algorithms and Data Structures in C

## About
This repository holds the code and some resources about implementing a handful of algorithms and data structures 
in C, as well as a lot of the basics in C development (like how to produce makefiles etc.)

I eventually hope to get into programming embedded systems and electronics, so I feel as though improving
my ability in C, and getting over that "fear" I feel when I look at a large page of C code would be worth while.

## Course
For the next few weeks, I'll just be following these course notes (my thanks to Jack Straub for his efforts):

And there is more information from the course's homepage, found here:
